## 🧠 How It Works

### **Text Processing Pipeline**
1. **Input Text** → Raw text data from various sources
2. **Preprocessing** → Cleaning, tokenization, and normalization
3. **Feature Extraction** → Convert text to numerical representations (TF-IDF, BoW)
4. **Modeling** → Apply machine learning or deep learning algorithms
5. **Prediction/Analysis** → Generate insights, classifications, or predictions

### **Deep Learning Workflow**
- **Word Embeddings** → Convert words to dense vector representations
- **RNN Architecture** → Process sequential data with memory
- **Training Loop** → Optimize model parameters using gradient descent
- **Prediction** → Generate next words or analyze text patterns

## 🧩 Project Overview

### **1. Named Entity Recognition**
- Identifies and classifies entities like people, organizations, and locations
- Uses both NLTK and spaCy for comprehensive entity extraction
- Example: "Ahmed works at Google in New York" → PERSON: Ahmed, ORG: Google, LOC: New York

### **2. Next Token Prediction**
- Implements RNN from scratch using PyTorch
- Learns context and predicts next words in sequences
- Example: "Pytorch is an" → predicts "amazing"

### **3. Part-of-Speech Tagging**
- Analyzes grammatical structure of sentences
- Tags words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
- Batch processes multiple sentences efficiently

### **4. Text Cleaning with Regex**
- Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline
- Removes special characters, numbers, and noise
- Implements stop word removal and text normalization

### **5. Sentiment Analysis**
- Uses NLTK's VADER for sentiment scoring
- Classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral
- Processes multiple reviews with compound sentiment scores

### **6. Text Data Processing**
- Advanced text manipulation with pandas
- Implements case conversion, substring operations, and pattern matching
- Creates comprehensive text analysis features

### **7. TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Converts text documents to numerical feature matrices
